This is a small, feature limited tool to launch an external program when a twitch stream goes online.

This is a single exe designed for constrained or simple usages, 
for a more full featured and traditional whizzbang program please use

## Usage

It's simple !
1. Enter twitch streamer account name
1. Check 'enabled'
1. Paste the full path to a batch to launch when a stream goes online.
